# MernifyBooks | Accounting Software (In Progress)

A full-featured accounting software solution built with the MERN stack, designed for modern finance teams and small businesses.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)

## 🧠 Database Flexibility

While the initial build uses **MongoDB** (NoSQL) for speed and flexibility, the system is being architected with **database abstraction** in mind.

### Supported/Planned Database Options:
- ✅ MongoDB (Current)
- 🔜 PostgreSQL (SQL-based)
- 🔜 MySQL (Optional via ORM)

> The backend will support switching between database engines with minimal changes, using abstraction patterns or ORMs (e.g., Mongoose for MongoDB, Sequelize/Prisma for SQL).


## ✅ Current Phase

- 🔧 **Design Phase**: Outlining system architecture and core functionalities.
- 📁 **Resource Gathering**: Collecting support files, libraries, and references needed for implementation.
- 🗂 **Database Schema Definition**: Designing models for transactions, accounts, ledgers, and reporting.
- 📡 **API Planning**: Planning RESTful endpoints for:
  - Financial Transactions (CRUD)
  - Chart of Accounts
  - Journal Entries
  - Financial Reports (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, etc.)
